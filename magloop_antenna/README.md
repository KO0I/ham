# Magnetic Loop Antennas for HF
======

## Introduction:

**TL:DR**:High efficiency/portability in exchange for very narrow bandwidth (a blessing in disguise, though for noisy environments)
## Theory of Operation:

## Parts:

### General Anatomy:

           Capacitor
             _| |_
          .-' | | '-.
        .'           '.
       /               \
      ;                 ;
      |   Inner Loop    |
      ;       .-.       ;
       \     (   )     /
        '.    '-'    .'
          '-._____.-'
  
          Outer Loop

* Adjustable Capacitor ~500pF or more
  * I've been told a "trombone style" capacitor is very effective if I need
    to homebrew it.
* Large diameter Copper Tubing (larger is more efficient)
* Coupling Loop
* Tripod or Other Stand

Note:
  3m copper tubing w/ 19mm diameter
  Mentions vacuum-variable and high-power transmitting variable capacitor
  Suggests that 5m lengths would be more ideal (why?)
  


### Interesting Side Note:
One common frustration with magnetic loop antennas is the need to constantly
re-tune the antenna for every major frequency change.

Here are some interesting solutions/workarounds that address the
constant-tuning demand:
