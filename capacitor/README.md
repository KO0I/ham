# High Voltage Capacitor
======

## Introduction:

Since I could not find a capacitor needed for the loop, I decided to build
one. In this directory, I have all of the capacitor parts that were used for
3D-printing. 
The goal is to have the capacitor have a value of over 100pF and be able to
not arc when 1kV is across the plates.

## Parts:

Besides the 3D-printed parts, I bought some M8 rat rod and had it cut into 5
equal lengths, as well as a lot of M8 nuts and washers to seperate the stators
and rotors.

## References:

I used Anwar von Sroka's design, with a few modifications. I have included the
pdf in this directory. The metal used was some Aluminum sheet cut with tin
snips and the edges were smoothed out with some emery board.
