# MMR-40 QRP SSB Transceiver

## Introduction:
by KD1JV

What is the MMR-40? It is a 40 meter rig with SSB (voice) and CW (Morse code)
operating modes. This is a low power (QRP) rig with up to 6 watts CW or PEP
(peak envelope power) output. This rig was designed for the ARRL Homebrew
Challenge, the goal of which was to come up with a functional CW/SSB
rig design which could be reproduced for under $50.00 using common hand
tools and a minimum of test equipment. The MMR-40 was one of two winners for
this contest. In theory, the parts cost of all new parts in single piece
quantity is about $32.00. The actual out of pocket costs will be some what
higher, because of the shipping and handling costs to get the parts to you.
The cost of wire and any tools you may need to buy are also not included
in the base price. 

Note: The full parts list with distributors part number is in a
seperate file in this repo.
